PEXRankChange
=============
PEXRankChange is a plugin designed to allow you to diversify the distribution of PermissionsEX permissions given to your staff;
its primary goal was to allow staff further down the chain to gain access to certain PEX commands, which were simplifyed to help with usage as well as putting in safety marks to protect higher staff.

This plugin has been designed for use on EmeraldWorld Minecraft Server, but feel free to use it on your own.
